        <h2>My interests.</h2>
        <div>I am a man of many interests. <br> My top interests include learning, watching movies and listening to music which is in no way diverse. My personal favourite movie "Good Will Hunting", while my favourite song of all time is probably "Someone Like you" by Adele,
        I am, from recently, a non smokeer and I love pets and animals. Most of my love for animals goes to my pet, Mokka who is an devil inside an angels physique</div>

        <h2>My hobbies.</h2>
        <div>
            Hobbies, for me are a routine. <br>
            My hobbies mostly consist of reading, gaming, coding and being an ally to the feminist agenda. I think that our hobbies make out who we are as a person and i try to use my daily given time to good use.
            Feeling productive at the end of the day is always my mission, and I think i will never break out of this <routine class=""></routine>
